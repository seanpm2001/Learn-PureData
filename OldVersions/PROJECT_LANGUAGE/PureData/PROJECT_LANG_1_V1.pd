#C Project language file 1
#C For: seanpm2001/Learn-PureData
#C About:
#C I decided to make PureData the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-PureData) as PureData is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the PureData programming language. It only makes sense to PureData the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
